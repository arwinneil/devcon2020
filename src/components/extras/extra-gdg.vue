				The GDG Mauritius is a local community-ran meetup for developers
				interested in resources and technology from Google Developers.
			</p>
			<p>
				GDGs are local groups of developers who are specifically interested in
				Google products and APIs. Each local group is called a GDG chapter and
				can host a variety of technical activities for developers - from just a
				few people getting together to watch our latest videos, to large
				gatherings with demos and tech talks, to hackathons.
			</p>
			<p>
				Disclaimer: GDG Mauritius is an independent user group; our activities
				and the opinions expressed here should in no way be linked to Google,
				the corporation.
