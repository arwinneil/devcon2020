# 2. Where to begin

- The first part of the project will be mostly Front-end Development(VueJS)
- Take a look at the [Project Board](https://github.com/mscraftsman/devcon2020/projects/1)
- It is likely there are open [issues](https://github.com/mscraftsman/devcon2020/issues) that you can help with.

# 3. How to contribute

1. [Pick an Issue](https://github.com/mscraftsman/devcon2020/issues) or Create an issue to help with
2. Comment on the issue and let everyone know you'll be helping on this. (to avoid duplicates)
3. Clone the `master` branch and resolve the issue locally.
4. Make a merge request to the `master` branch
5. One of the maintainers will review the PR and merge, else there will be comments if adjustments are required.

# 4. Deployment to Staging

We're using Github Pages & Netlify as a our 'staging' server during development.

You should be able to see the sites here :

Github Page (serves the docs) : https://mscraftsman.github.io/devcon2020/
Netlify Staging : https://compassionate-swirles-4863e9.netlify.com/

Once a maintainer merges new changes in the branch `master`, netlify will
automatically trigger a new build pipeline and after a few minutes the changes will be shown on the staging website.
